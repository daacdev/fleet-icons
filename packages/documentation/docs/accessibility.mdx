# Accessibility

According to the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Equivalent),
you only need to add the `<title>` and `<desc>` tags to the `svg` component.
With this in mind, the `title` and `desc` props were added to support icon accessibility.

Alternatively you can add icon accessibility as [suggested by Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#accessibility)

## Examples

```jsx
<Tools
  // highlight-start
  title="Tools Icon"
  desc="Example of a tools icon"
  // highlight-end
/>
```

```jsx
<Tools
  // highlight-start
  role="img"
  aria-label="Tools Icon"
  // highlight-end
/>
```
